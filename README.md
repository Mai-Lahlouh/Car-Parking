# Car-Parking
In conjunction with escalating car numbers, several challenges become more noticeable. In the day-to-day lives of individuals, some are struggling to discover satisfying parking. Others are suffering to park their cars by themselves effectively. For this reason, a lot of problem-solving engineers were working to reduce the effects of these difficulties.

In this project, a supportive system implemented with the aim of enhancing the parking process. The smart parking application will be a guide for any driver willing to find a suitable spot for his car. The application shows the number of empty spots in parking registered with the application on a Google map of parking. The parking supported by an infrastructure to detect the number of empty spots. The app control the movements of a prototype car in four directions to reach the desired place. The car model parks automatically by activating the auto-park option using the app. The components in the model make auto parking happen. Arduino, reed switch, ultrasonic sensors, and DC motors combine to create an auto-parking system. Following detection by the reed switch, the ultrasonic sensors on both sides take precise measurements to assess the optimal parking space. The car model will move forward in search of an appropriate spot if no suitable spot is available.
