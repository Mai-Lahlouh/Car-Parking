# Car-Parking
In conjunction with escalating car numbers, several challenges become more noticeable. In the day-to-day lives of individuals, some are struggling to discover satisfying parking. Others are suffering to park their cars by themselves effectively. For this reason, a lot of problem-solving engineers were working to reduce the effects of these difficulties.

In this project, a supportive system implemented with the aim of enhancing the parking process. This innovative system helps users find available parking spots by displaying the number of empty spaces in registered parking areas on a Google map. The system includes a prototype car that can be controlled via the application to navigate and park automatically.

## Key Features:

- Real-Time Parking Availability: Displays the number of available parking spots on a Google map.
- Auto-Park Functionality: The prototype car can be directed to park itself automatically using the app.
- Advanced Sensors and Control: Utilizes Arduino, reed switches, ultrasonic sensors, and DC motors to detect parking spaces and control the car's movements.

The system's infrastructure is designed to detect and measure empty parking spots accurately. The ultrasonic sensors and reed switches work together to identify suitable parking spaces, allowing the prototype car to navigate and park itself efficiently.

This project not only highlights my skills in developing practical solutions but also demonstrates my ability to integrate technology with real-world applications to address common urban challenges.
